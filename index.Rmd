# Intro {-}

I do not currently have a strong vision on the structure of this book yet, but for now, I just see it
as a convenient place to dump my blog-like writings into, while also leveraging the power of R Markdown.



I expect most of the topics discussed to be centered around the world of finance - seeing as finance
is the highest calling of mankind, it is only just to give finance its due. I would like to use a writing
approach that is data-focused and visual heavy, which is partly the motivation for using R Markdown as
the medium of choice. I expect that many of the articles will take on an exploratory tone, where I start a series of questions or a topic that I would like to learn more about and then walk through the process of acquiring a deeper understanding. 


As of now, I do not expect that I will include many, if any code snippets in this book - though the entire source code will be available on my Github for the those who are interested. I am planning to write another book that is more heavily focused on the programming guides so I will try to keep code clutter out of the way of the primary content.


## Topics





```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
